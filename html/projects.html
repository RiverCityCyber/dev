    <h1>Welcome to my Projects Page!</h1>

        <p>In the world of computing, hands on experience is one of the best educators. Unlike medicine, the tools
            required
            to experiment in computing are significantly cheaper, and not to mention the reduced risk to life and limb.
        </p>
        <p>I encourage everyone interested in computing to go to their nearest e-recycle place, purchase a cheap
            computer to
            tinker with, and start experimenting. The best way to learn is to do.</p>
        <p>Incase you need a few ideas on where to start, or want to peruse some of my past projects, feel free to look
